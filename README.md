# shadow-switch-vpn
a client-side vpn using openVPN n VPNGate

Shadow Switch VPN is a Python-based tool that automates the process of connecting to VPN servers from different locations using VPNGate's free VPN server list. This tool allows users to seamlessly switch their IP address to appear as though they are browsing from various countries around the world.

## Features

- **Automatic VPN Setup**: Automatically checks if OpenVPN is installed and installs it if not.
- **Dynamic VPN Configuration**: Downloads and configures VPN settings for the selected country from VPNGate.
- **User Approval for Downloads**: Prompts users to approve any downloads, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Administrative privileges to install software and configure the network
- Internet access to download OpenVPN and configuration files

## Installation and Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shadowswitch.git
cd shadowswitch
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Script

To start using **Shadowswitch**, run the following command:

```bash
python shadowswitch.py
```

The script will prompt you to choose a country, check if OpenVPN is installed, and guide you through setting up the VPN connection.

## Future Roadmap

### 1. User Interface (UI) Development

- **Objective**: Create a user-friendly GUI to make the tool accessible to non-technical users.
- **Technologies**: Consider using Python's `tkinter` or `PyQt` for a cross-platform desktop application, or `Electron` for a web-based interface.
- **Features**:
  - Country selection via a dropdown menu
  - Real-time status updates on connection progress
  - Notifications for connection success or failure

### 2. Security Improvements

- **Objective**: Enhance the security of the tool to ensure safe and private connections.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
  - Encrypt the VPN configuration files stored locally to protect sensitive data.
  - Regularly update the OpenVPN installation and configuration to the latest versions to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### 3. Enhanced VPN Server Selection

- **Objective**: Improve the selection of VPN servers to optimize performance and reliability.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement server latency checks to automatically choose the fastest server.
  - Add functionality to filter servers by speed, uptime, and load.
  - Allow users to save preferred servers for quick access.

### 4. Automated Updates

- **Objective**: Ensure that Shadowswitch stays up-to-date with the latest VPN configurations and software.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement an auto-update feature for the tool itself.
  - Regularly check and download the latest VPNGate server list.
  - Notify users of any critical updates to OpenVPN or the script.

### 5. Support for Additional VPN Protocols

- **Objective**: Expand the tool to support multiple VPN protocols beyond OpenVPN, such as WireGuard.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add support for WireGuard, including automatic installation and configuration.
  - Allow users to choose their preferred VPN protocol during setup.
  - Implement protocol-specific optimizations for better performance.

### 6. Documentation and Community Involvement

- **Objective**: Create comprehensive documentation and build a community around Shadowswitch.
- **Tasks**:
  - Write detailed guides on installing and using Shadowswitch.
  - Create a contribution guide to encourage open-source contributions.
  - Set up a discussion forum or Discord channel for user support and feature requests.
